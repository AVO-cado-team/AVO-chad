# AvoChad Backend
This backend was implemented for the AvoChad project. It is a REST API that allows users to create and manage their own __avocados chats__.
This backend is built using the [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) framework.

# API Documentation

## Authentication Controller
The API uses [JWT](https://jwt.io/) for authentication. The JWT is sent in the `Authorization` header of each request. The JWT is valid for 1 hour.

### Endpoints

#### Login
`POST /login`
As input to login We'll get AuthenticationDTO object with username / email and password. If the username and password are correct, the API will return a JWT token.
Otherwise, it will catch a custom exception and return a `401` **Unauthorized Error Response**.

#### Register
`POST /register`
As input to register We'll get UserDTO object with firstName, secondName, username, email and password. If the username and email are not already taken, the API will return a JWT token.
